title: Minmatar FL33T Alliance Tenets
excerpt: >
  As we grow bigger and bigger, it’s important to remember that Eve is a game based on community. We fly together; we fight together; we die together. As such, we’ve come together to formulate a list of expectations for members of FL33T, so that we can all continue to prosper together. It is important to remember that on the other side of the screen(s) are other human beings.

## We Like the Game

*   Arguably one of the most important aspects of FL33T; we love Eve Online, and all aspects of it. Some of the content we take part in might be in High-Sec, some of it might be in Null-Sec. We aren’t a “Faction Warfare Alliance”; We’re an Alliance that takes part in Faction Warfare. If you want an alliance that only does FW content, I’m sure there are others around that you could join.
    

## We Like Each Other

*   **Respect the Content:** One of the things that makes FL33T great is the amount of external content we generate; Reddit propaganda, alliance memes, Youtube videos and a general good vibe contribute greatly to our Alliance Culture. We’re all friends here; have some fun with it and don’t take the game too seriously.
    
*   **Respect the Capsuleer:** Trust is the basis for any organisation in Eve; betraying each other at the alliance level is a good way to throw a wrench in everything we are building. As such; awoxing, undercutting and other in-game slights directed towards FL33T members are actions that are frowned upon.
    
*   **Respect the Human:** It should go without saying that racism, exclusion, or other offensive behaviour will not be tolerated. FL33T encompasses people from every timezone, and all walks of life.
    

## We Support Ourselves

*   **We aren’t a Newbro Alliance:** As such we have some expectation that you know how to play the game. However, if you do have any questions, there’s a high chance that someone around will be able to answer; as long as it’s not during the middle of a fleet operation. _90% of fleet-related questions can be answered by the MOTD anyway._
    
    *   With the amount of content available to us, it is expected that you can make enough ISK to fly what’s needed. Luckily, we’re staged in the middle of Minmatar Faction Warfare space, opening up one of the best ways to generate ISK in the game. Abyssals, Incursions, and Industry are also great options available to us.
        

## We Keep it [Cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-iRW1SjKTc)

*   **Starting arguments? Walk away.** Unnecessary conflict between our own members is something we don’t stand for. First and foremost Eve is a game, and we’re all here to have a good time. Choosing to hinder other players’ experience is a one-way ticket out of the Alliance. If there is a serious issue that needs to be handled, it can be directed to the HR Team.
    

## We Adapt Fast

*   Our goals, both short and long term, may change due to the huge variety of content available to us, and as such it’s common to switch it up often. While it may be daunting to have to skill into and buy a new ship every now and then, with the sheer volume of content we have access to it shouldn’t be an issue.
    

## We Like Content

*   **Eve is a two-sided game:** Content is a two-way street. We kill ships, we lose ships, the cycle continues and it’s a good time. We’re going to lose every now and then, and that’s fine.
    

These tenets are what makes FL33T what it is, and we’ve come a long way off the back of our strong Alliance culture. We fight, we feed, but most importantly we have fun. We do not have the brain cells to focus on drama; they’re already occupied debating which frontline to push. At the end of the day, feel free to reach out to HR if you have any questions.

Fly safe, but not too safe. O7_READ THE DAMN MOTD_
