Día’s writings identify Triglavian technology and more broadly Abyssal Deadspace as corrupting influences on New Eden. A survivor of the Turnur disaster and the sole remaining member of her clan, Día blames the use of Triglavian technology for the destruction of her home planet. She has also condemned the Minmatar Republic for failing to prevent the catastrophe.

Though Kamí Día inspired the Ashes of Turnur, the group has no combined hierarchy. The Ashes is a loose association of rebel clans and military deserters who abandoned the Republic to follow Día’s philosophies. These philosophies are based on a vision of pre-occupation Matari that contradicts the findings of Republic historians and archaeologists. According to Día, prior to the Amarr invasion, Minmatar society focused less on the tribes and more on individual clans and personal freedoms. Freedoms that Día believes can only be regained through suffering and violence. As she puts it in her collection From the Flames, ”Death has changed us, but it has also burnt away the lies of progress. So, let us be joyful, and show those who are less fortunate the lessons the fire taught us.”

The philosopher’s radical anti-Abyssal perspective has gained popularity beyond the borders of the Republic. Her writings have become bestsellers in the Gallente Federation. In the Amarr Empire, the Ministry of Internal Order has banned her work because they challenge all forms of national authority. Ashes of Turnur sympathizers have also been arrested on Caldari Prime. CONCORD has even declared the Ashes a cluster-wide terrorist organization following their attacks on Caldari facilities.
