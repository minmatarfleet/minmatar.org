If you’re experiencing unexpected behavior on the website, such as issues adding characters, viewing fleets, or other problems, try the following steps (one at a time) to resolve it:

1. Ensure you’re logged into your browser with the same Discord account you used to add the characters. You can log in to Discord [here](https://discord.com/app).
2. Click [Clear Cache](BASE_URL/redirects/clear_cache/), as it has resolved issues for some users in the past.
3. Logout and log back in.

If none of the above solutions fix the issue, please report it in [#help](https://discordapp.com/channels/1041384161505722368/1183401618943791186).
