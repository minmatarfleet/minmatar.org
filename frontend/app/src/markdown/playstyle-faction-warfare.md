Faction Warfare is a content haven primarily driven by battleships, battlecruisers, cruisers, and destroyers- an excellent place to cut your teeth without ruining your wallet.

- Endless 1v1 fights (frigates, destroyers)
- Constant small gang (nanogang, cruisers, etc)
- Occasional mid-scale fights (battlefields, ice heists, 30-50 pilots)

Our goal in faction warfare isn't map painting, that's for soverignty space. We aim to make the Amarr Empire miserable by denying them sites, killing their fleets, and crushing their slaver spirit.
