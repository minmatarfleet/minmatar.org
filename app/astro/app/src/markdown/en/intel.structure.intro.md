# How to scan structures?

Structures are the largest conflict driver in EVE Online. They are the primary target during all wars, and lead to all of those large fleet battles that you see in the news. There are three important elements that a fleet commander must know for every structure,

- The reinforcement timer (when this structure can be killed)
- The structure fitting (just like a ship, structures have fittings)
- The structureâ€™s position (what kind of moon the structure is on, etc)

In this course, you will learn how to obtain this information and provide it to a fleet commander. Through this activity, you might just be the small spark that creates a war!
