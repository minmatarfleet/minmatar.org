Data on the JSONs of this folder shouldn't change too frequently and can be generated by the backend system and published for the application on specifics URLs.

Some of them might never change or data not be handled on the backend system and can be deployed statically with the application. E.g: modules-icon-lookup.json and structure.id.lookup.json
