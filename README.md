# minmatar.org
Platform for Minmatar Fleet

# Prerequisites
- Install Python
- Install Docker and Docker Desktop (Mac, WSL)
- Install Docker Compose
- Install `pyenv` on your machine (e.g `brew install pyenv`, google for other operating systems)
- Install `pipenv` on your machine (e.g `pip install --user --upgrade pipenv`)
- Install `pre-commit` on your machine (e.g `brew install`)
- Install libmariadb-dev or libmysqlclient-dev

# Quickstart
1. Copy the contents of `docker-compose-local.yml` into `docker-compose.yml`
2. Setup your `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file
  - Create an application [here](https://developers.eveonline.com/) with CCP and get the ESI Client ID and ESI Secret Key
  - By default the database user passwords are `example` for users `root` and `tools`, if you'd like this to be different update the relevant sections in `.env`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `dev/mariadb/setup.sql`
  - Get the auth database password from BearThatCares
3. Generate a self signed tls key that will be used for the reverse proxy. `openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt`
  - these paths are the defaults in the compose file for mounting the tls certs. You can change these to be whatever you want.
4. Run `docker compose up -d` to create and start the containers. In the background this sets up the needed database users and database.
  - Append the `--build app` flag to the compose command to rebuild the image if you've made code changes.
5. Navigate to https://localhost/api/ and you should also see the website (via the proxy)

This isn't a perfect setup and we're still working on streamlining it. If you have issues reach out to the technology team and we'll do our best to help.
Once you set this up once it will keep your db setup between development instances and you will only need to migrate if you change the database structure.


# Commands
- `for x in $(sed -e 's/#.*//' .env.local | grep '=') ; do export $x ; done` for populating env from .env
