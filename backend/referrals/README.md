Overview
========
API for referral links. Alliance members can create themselves referral links to various
alliance tools and wiki pages, and then share them through in-game channels etc. The
APi will then track the number of unique clicks on the link per member.

For example...

`https://api.minmatar.org/referrals?page=freight&code=Q80`

would track that the freight guide was accessed via a referral link from the user with
code Q80, and then redirect the user to `https://my.minmatar.org/market/freight/standard/`
